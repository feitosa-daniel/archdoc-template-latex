# Architecture Document

This repository contains a LaTeX template for a typical architecture document. This template is tailored for the course https://ocasys.rug.nl/current/catalog/course/WMCS004-05[Software Architecture (WMCS004-05)] of the University of Groningen.

## Generating a PDF

The easiest way to get started with the template
is to create a blank project on [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com/)
and upload a copy of this repository to it.
That will provide version control out of the box.

Otherwise, you should have a local installation and know how to use it. If so, we also provide a Makefile for convenience.

This is not a LaTeX tutorial.
If you are not used to LaTeX, take the time to get yourself acquainted
and explore the template. Part of the time-consuming tasks (e.g. layout)
are solved already. Adding your content should be fairly straightforward
(maybe tables less so).

## Tracking Changes

The course requires that updates to the document throughout the weeks are tracked.
To generate a PDF with the changes highlighted, you can use the [`latexdiff`](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff) tool. 
If you are using Overleaf, there are guidelines to use `latexdiff` [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/How_to_use_latexdiff_on_Overleaf).
